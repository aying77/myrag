# Benchmarks
This directory contains benchmarks for the FlexRAG framework. We conduct these experiments for the following reasons:
1. We hope to help users gain a deeper understanding of the various components in RAG and determine their impact on the overall RAG system.
2. We aim to test the FlexRAG framework, which will help us reduce potential bugs.

## Directory Structure
